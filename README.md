News App 🗞
GitHub license

News App is a simple news app 🗞️ which uses NewsAPI to fetch top news headlines from the API. The main aim of this app is to be a leading example of how to build Modern Android applications for all Android Developers

The codebase focuses 👓 on following key things:

Code structuring, style and comments
Dependency injection 🗡
Offline first ✈️
And tests 🛠
The idea is to keep the app super simple while demonstrating new libraries and tools which makes it easier to build high quality applications.API key 🔑
You'll need to provide API key to fetch the news from the News Service (API). Currently the news is fetched from NewsAPI

Generate an API key (It's only 2 steps!) from NewsAPI
Create new file named -> credentials.properties in our project root folder
Add the API key as shown below [Make sure to keep the double quotes]:
    NEWS_API_KEY = "<INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY>"
Build the app
Enjoyyyyy 🎉
